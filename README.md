# **House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques**


---


## **Introduction**
*The prediction of house prices is a fundamental problem in the field of real estate and finance. Accurately estimating the value of a house is crucial for various stakeholders, such as buyers, sellers, and financial institutions. In this Jupyter notebook, we aim to tackle this challenge by applying advanced regression techniques to predict house prices based on a set of given features.*

## **Dataset**
*The dataset used for this task is the "[House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview)" dataset, provided by Kaggle. It consists of a comprehensive set of features describing various aspects of residential properties, such as the size, location, condition, and amenities. The dataset includes both numerical and categorical features, offering a diverse range of information to capture the complexity of house pricing.*

## **Objective**
*The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust regression model that accurately predicts house prices based on the available features. We will explore the dataset, perform data preprocessing, conduct feature engineering, and experiment with different regression algorithms. The evaluation of the models will be based on appropriate performance metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE) and more.*

## **Methodology**
*Our approach involves several key steps:*

1. Data loading and exploration:
    > We will load the dataset and gain initial insights into its structure, feature types, and statistics. This step allows us to familiarize ourselves with the data and identify potential challenges or areas for improvement.
2. Data preprocessing:
    > We will address missing values, handle outliers, and perform necessary data transformations. This step aims to prepare the dataset for modeling by ensuring data quality and compatibility.
3. Feature engineering:
    > We will create new features, combine existing ones, and encode categorical variables to extract meaningful information and enhance the predictive power of the model.
4. Model training and evaluation:
    > We will train various regression models using the prepared dataset. We will employ advanced regression techniques such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting algorithms. The models will be evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics (RMSE) required by the challenge organisers.
5. Model selection:
    > Based on the performance of the models, we will select the most suitable one to achieve optimal results with the training data.
6. Prediction and submission:
    > Once the final model is trained and optimized, we will make predictions on the unseen test data and prepare the submission file in the required format.

## **Result**
The final model used a Stacking Regressor, allowing for ensemble learning with multiple base models. Using the required evaluation metric of Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE), the result achieved on the unseen test set was: 0.13104.
